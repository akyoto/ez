# Zen

Zen programming language (work in progress).

## Features

* Simple (inspired by Go)
* Memory-safe (inspired by Rust)
* Functional (inspired by Haskell)
* Fast compilation (inspired by V)
* Zero-cost abstractions (inspired by Rust)

## Design goals

* Importing a module should have no side effects
* Modules should be highly reusable (not bound to predefined data structures)
* ...TODO...
